## Is Quotex Legal in India in 2024?

Quotex\'s legality in India is a subject of ongoing debate. While binary
options trading is legal in certain jurisdictions, India has strict
regulations governing foreign trading platforms. Quotex operates under a
license from an offshore regulator, but it is not registered with the
Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). This raises questions
about its legal standing for Indian users.

Quotex claims to have robust compliance measures, but these are
difficult to verify without a regulatory presence in India. The Indian
government has also expressed concerns about the risks associated with
online trading platforms.

The future of Quotex in India largely depends on regulatory
developments. If the Indian government decides to further tighten
regulations or outright ban foreign trading platforms, the accessibility
of Quotex may diminish significantly.

Indian traders should recognize the legal ambiguities involved in using
platforms like Quotex and proceed with caution.
